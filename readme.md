## Project Description

### Overview:
The proposed project is an expense tracker designed to cater to individuals sharing the same living space, such as flatmates in an apartment. The primary objective is to facilitate the tracking of both individual and group expenses, providing users with insightful visualizations of their spending patterns through interactive charts.

### User Requirements:

#### Signup Page:
- New users can sign up using their email ID and create a secure password for their apartment profile.
- Email ID and password will undergo validation, and users will be required to click on a signup button to complete the profile creation.
- Email validation will include the use of a one-time password (OTP) for added security.

#### Sign-in Page:
- Existing users can log in by entering their email ID and password.
- User credentials will be authenticated, and in case of a forgotten password, a password reset option will be available.
- Upon successful login, users will be directed to the home page.

#### Home Page:
The home page offers two main options:
1. **New Flatmate:**
   - Users can create a username and password for a new flatmate.
   - An input form collects essential details about the new flatmate.
   
2. **Existing Flatmate:**
   - Existing flatmates can log in using their credentials.

#### Flatmate Dashboard:
1. The dashboard displays an expense chart for the individual.
2. Users can log their expenses, specifying the type of expense.
3. Expenses are categorized into:
   - Common Expense
   - Personal Expense
4. Common expenses will have various subcategories.

#### Notification Features:
1. For recurring expenses, users can set due dates, and notifications will be sent to their email.
2. Users will input monthly budgets and savings. Notifications will be sent when 80% of the budget is reached.
3. Notifications for common expenses (e.g., Gas, Electricity, WIFI, Rent) will be sent on their due dates.

#### Common Expense Page:
1. Provides information on all common expenses within the flat.
2. Tracks flatmates who have paid expenses and those who haven't.
3. Presents analysis charts for common expenses.

#### Sign Out:
A sign-out button in the menu bar allows users to log out, redirecting them to the main login page.
